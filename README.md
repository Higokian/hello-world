# hello-world
My very first repository to learn and practice Github basics. Also will be used for project ideas/discussions.

My name is Jason. I'm a recent AAS in Computer Programming graduate and a current BS in Computer Science student. My biggest interest is in Web Development and Game Development (I've yet to learn any Game Development, but I surely look forward to learning it). I've spent a fair amount of time practicing Web Design using HTML and CSS. I also have taken courses on SEO, E-Commerce, and Photoshop. I also have exposure to Python, C++, Xamarin (in MS Studio coding in C#), Java, COBOL, RPG, MySQL, Access Database and the rest of the Office 365 Suite.
